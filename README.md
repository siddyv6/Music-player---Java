Music-player---Java
===================
A music player created using java, which uses a SQL databsae which is unfortunately tied to my university account therefore the databse will only work on the universitys network or on there virtual machines.

The music player allows the users to see there music library, add/delete to songs, rate songs. There is a open a connection and statement to SQL Server database which then uses different methods containing different sql statements which do different things in the database. Each methods has to have a try and catch in order to catch any exeception thrown back from the database.
The Music player does all but actually run music, this is due to time limitation. However in the future I hope to be able to run musics files.
